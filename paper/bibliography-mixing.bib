@article{ruiters-2010-interpolation,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel exemplar-based technique for the interpolation between two
              textures that combines patch-based and statistical approaches. Motivated by the notion of texture as
              a largely local phenomenon, we warp and blend small image neighborhoods prior to patch-based texture
              synthesis. In addition, interpolating and enforcing characteristic image statistics faithfully
              handles high frequency detail. We are able to create both intermediate textures as well as
              continuous transitions. In contrast to previous techniques computing a global morphing
              transformation on the entire input exemplar images, our localized and patch-based approach allows us
              to successfully interpolate between textures with considerable differences in feature topology for
              which no smooth global warping field exists.},
